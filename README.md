## Description

I was motivated to create a README generator because it is an efficient way to make a README file without distracting from the coding work, itself.

When using this README generator, you'll find responsive prompts that populate a detailed and structured README file.

## Installation

Once the repository is downloaded, please navigate to the correct file path in your command terminal and enter 'npm i' to install the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Once necessary dependencies are installed, run 'node index' in your command terminal to begin the README generation.

Future updates will include more license options.
